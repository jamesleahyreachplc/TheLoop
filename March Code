              <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">Welcome to our March edition of the Loop in 2023. Spring is in the air and we are continuing to build on a hugely successful start to the year. We’re entering the third month of the year with lots of successes across our editorial, marketing and commercial teams. 
Don't forget to get in touch with us at  <a href="mailto:theloopireland@reachplc.com" style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;"><b>theloopireland@reachplc.com</b></a> for anything you would like to see us cover.

              <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">The marketing team attended the Eastside Awards at the Stormont Hotel on behalf of Daily Mirror NI & Belfast Live. The Eastside Awards celebrate all that is special about East Belfast, with awards from Favourite Teacher to Favourite Cafe. Belfast Live continues to place itself at the heart of communities across Northern Ireland and were once again proud sponsors on the night. The love for competitions continues with huge volumes of entries across all our brands. Belfast Live had one of the highest entry rates ever for the Elephant and Rock hotel stay giveaway, with over 4,000 entries. Lastly, ahead of the biggest week of the year for print, we’ve launched our Irish Mirror Racing newsletter. If you're feeling like you're going to have a flutter on Cheltenham it's worth signing up for all the big tips from the Irish Mirror. Pints are on the winner. Giddy Up!

              <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">We had a long-awaited return to our new newsroom in the Dublin hub this month. It was great to see so many of the editorial teams from the Irish Daily Star and Irish Mirror meeting and mixing in some cases for the first time in person. There was even a few drinks to bid some of our departing colleagues good luck with their adventures in America on <a href="https://www.irishstar.com/" style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;"><b>irishstar.com</b></a> which went live. Laura Colgan kindly sent us her goodbye picture on route to New York. Meeting more regularly now that the office is open can only help improve our journalism which has been in good shape this month when we set the agenda by breaking big stories such as the GAA star at the centre of a major fraud inquiry and the charging of a high profile celebrity with sex abuse allegations. We're now under starters orders for Cheltenham, the biggest selling newspaper week of the year with undoubtedly the best editorial and marketing packages around. Here's to a few winners as well...

              <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">It's been a brilliant month for our commercial teams in Dublin, Cork, and Belfast with agency pitches, industry events, and webinars. Our teams have had a record number of briefs in and are off to a cracking start with some brilliant wins across the board. The Dublin team have been busy preparing for Cheltenham with some excellent campaigns from the Bookmakers. Season Three of Nicorette’s I’ll Start Monday podcast will be going live next month and a compelling campaign from the Insolvency Service of Ireland is due to launch this month. The Belfast Team attended a Business Live Networking event last week in the Stormont hotel along with hosting a meet the Media event. A big welcome to Kresimir Horvat who joins the Client Service Team. Kres comes with a wealth of experience having previously worked in outdoor at PML. Now in his fourth week, it's great to see he has hit the ground running and settling in so quickly as business begins to ramp up.

<h4 style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">Tell us About Yourself</h4>
<p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">I grew up in Dublin before moving to Naas in my 30's where I live with my wife and 2 children. I've been with Reach for 5 years now - worked in media sales for just over 10. I don't have a huge amount of time for hobbies these days - I'm more of a taxi driver for the kids and their own sports / activities. I wouldn't change it for the world though and I still manage to squeeze in some time to play darts and listen to Crypto Youtubers!

              <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">The January issue of RSVP closed at 19,838 (-2% YoY). We are on track to finish the month of February ahead of the Circulation budget on all of our daily and Sunday titles, which is great given we had our new St Brigids Bank Holiday and a mid-term break. The new League of Ireland season kicked off on Friday 18th February supported by an 8 page pullout in the Irish Daily Mirror which will hopefully increase sales as the season progresses. The Six Nations campaign is in full swing with Ireland winning its first two games. This bodes well for the triple crown and possible Grand Slam decider against England next month on St Paddy's Bank Holiday weekend - fingers crossed! Looking ahead it’s all about sport in March - our biggest month of the year for circulation and we are hoping to match or beat last year's performances.

Early signs are really encouraging and we’d like to say a big well done to the team on its launch - this has been a massive undertaking but we know it will be a huge success. Meanwhile, Irish Mirror’s Rachel welcomes her beautiful little boy Jonah into the world three weeks ago. According to Rachel, he is a brilliant little baby. A huge congratulations from everyone in Reach!

              <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;"> We had another Reach Ireland reconnect event in the Belfast office and our first ever in the Dublin office. It was to celebrate Pancake Tuesday where a variety of flavoured pancakes was served up with tasting toppings from Nutella, lemon and sugar, syrup and whipped cream topped with blueberries and strawberries. It was a day when all diets and healthy eating plans went out the window. It's safe to say everyone's sweet craving was met. 😋 #pancakeday #youbatterbelieveit
