              <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">It's surreal to see a world cup in November, almost as surreal as not seeing Ireland winning it (not!) but as always Reach has been at the forefront of coverage. This month we launched our World Cup Wall Chart - a perfect addition to all the syndicates! Readers can pick up their glossy chart in print across ROI & NI. After this, a downloadable and printable version was launched, ensuring we reached our widespread online audience with our amazing word cup content. As always, a big well done to the whole marketing team for making this a huge success! Heading west now and we’ve also launched our first brand campaign for our newest live site GalwayBeo. It's great to see the campaign up and running with impactful outdoor print and digital ad formats running throughout the city. Editor Darragh almost crashed his car when he spotted Galway Beo on the big outdoor screen! And finally, we scooped silver at the PANI Awards for our Opening Eyes on Homelessness campaign.

              <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">Lots of congratulations to go around this month. Not least to the Irish Daily Star’s chief reporter Paul Healy and partner Cian who married last Friday in the lovely surrounds of Kinsale.  We would all like to join in wishing them both every future happiness. Congratulations also go to our winners at the recent Newsbrands Irish Journalism Awards where Dave Coughlan was named the Best Sportswriter of the Year.  Mostafa Darwish won podcast of the year for his work with the Irish Examiner’s podcast ‘The Lost American’ while the Irish Daily Star won Headline of the Year for its Kinahan cartel front page splash ‘Kiss Your Assets Dubai.’  Former political correspondent Ciara Phelan was also crowned Young Journalist of the year for a series of exclusive stories published in the Irish Mirror. And well done again to all our nominees who could easily have picked up a gong on the day in many hard-fought categories.  It was great to see so many colleagues flying the flag at the Mansion House.
Also this month thanks and well done to Group Environment Correspondent Shauna Corr who delivered first class coverage from the COP 27 summit in Egypt over two weeks for all our titles – while also finding the time to present the new Reach climate podcast Tipping Point which is now live!  Please listen and share. While we are already looking at a busy run-in to the festive season there will no doubt also be opportunities to get together in the weeks ahead!

              <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">Our commercial teams have been busy with some brilliant campaigns in the run-up to Christmas and a couple of nice wins heading into 2023. It's a good thing that our Belfast team won big at this year’s PANI awards winning a Gold award for their Electric Ireland Power of Pause campaign along with a Silver award for Best Media Owner Sales Team of the Year. The same can't be said for the Dublin commercial team who tanked at the Group M charity quiz night. They could be spotted drowning their sorrows with pints of Guinness. Thankfully their selling skills are far better than their general knowledge.
The Dublin team will also be getting a new starter - Tegan McCluskey who joins us from DMG Media. She brings with her a wealth of digital experience and we can’t wait to welcome her to the team.</p>

<h4 style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">Tell us About Yourself</h4>
<p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">Live and grew up in Belfast, have a young family, and interests include football, GAA, and reading, but these have gone by the wayside a bit since my daughter came along.</p>

<h4 style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">What does your Role Involve</h4>
<p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">Without going into too much detail, my role for both Belfast and Dublin offices involves looking after the premises to provide a safe and comfortable environment to help enable building users to perform each of their roles and also ensuring that the two buildings are compliant.</p>

<h4 style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">Top 5 Dinner Guests</h4>
<p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">George Best, Billy Connelly, Zinedine Zidane. Paudi O' Shea and my grandfather.</p>

It's the second time Dave has picked up this award. A shout-out to Rob Baker for producing a brilliant World Cup wallchart. His creation helped push sales up in both Star and Mirror.

              <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">Our free glossy World Cup wallchart delivered some great lifts for the Irish Daily Mirror (5%), Irish Daily Star (4%), and 2.5% on the Daily Mirror in NI. Premier League fixtures resume mid-December after the World Cup finishes. The October issue of RSVP magazine closed at 19,333, and we are waiting on the RSVP Home special to close in mid-December. The last RSVP Country special of the year went on sale Tuesday 22nd November, in time to hit the Christmas market. Hutch's trial continues to provide some explosive front pages.

              <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">While the audiences have been turbulent, in part due to factors out of our control, there has been some brilliant content published across our sites in this past month. GalwayBeo and Buzz continue to buck the trend; Galway has set a new audience record for the second consecutive month (with 10 days to spare!), while Buzz is set to break the 1m barrier for the first time. It's set to be a busy time in Irish politics as we get a new Taoiseach next month, and you can keep up with developments through Louise Burne's Party Lines newsletter, which launched last week.

              <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">On the 2nd of December Reach will celebrate International Day of Persons with Disabilities (IDPD) in the Belfast Hub. Globally 1 in 7 of us live with a disability, many of which are not immediately apparent and known as 'Invisible' (Hidden) disabilities which also have their own set of challenges. 

Also a big thank you to everyone who completed the Reach D&I survey. Key takeaways from this include: D&I in Ireland needs more relevancy to the Irish office, Its the small stuff that matters, low key events and getting people reconnected and together are very important, Reach Mind has a high awareness level however people have little knowledge on the other networks.  Watch this space for us taking on your feedback and your ideas. We’ll be kicking it off with
 <b>REACH CHAT</b> - thank you to whoever suggested this! Details to follow soon. </p>
