              <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">The Irish Mirror surprised their biggest Fan on his 11th Birthday. In a heartwarming gesture, The Irish Mirror recently made 11-year-old Kyle's birthday unforgettable with a special surprise visit and a framed cutout. Kyle Morrissey, who is non-verbal and has autism, shares a unique connection with the paper as he adores the captivating images accompanying the articles and the TV listings.

                <br>A Warm Welcome to Alana Loftus, Our First Boston Reporter. The Irish Star US is absolutely thrilled to introduce Alana Loftus as the latest addition to the team. The team is very excited about getting stuck into one of the US' most vital Irish communities.  Congratulations are in order for Nadia Wynn (n√©e Breen), who managed to find time to leave the depths of the Belfast Live early shift to marry Conor - and jet off to Dubai. Love must be in the air in Belfast as it's the team's second wedding of the summer, after Conor Coyle tied the knot with Megan in Malaga before honeymooning in Vietnam. Elsewhere, a warm welcome to Andrew Quinn who has joined the Irish Mirror team from National World.

<br>Let's dive into the world of commercial! In our Belfast office the NI Reach Solutions team attended a PANI Business Breakfast with Kantar Media at the new Ulster University campus in Belfast. A valuable, informative and insightful morning was had as the new NI data release was presented on the latest consumer consumption trends across the media landscape. Our very own Caroline Christie recently played the role of judge for Zenith's internal awards known as the "Zemmies."  She singled out the McDonald's team campaign #McNuggetworthy as her personal favourite. Their campaign was a standout as it was an all-encompassing campaign using many touchpoints to reach out to the selected audience. Our Reach Solutions team also participated in Denstu‚Äôs annual DIG Day, where suppliers from across the industry faced off in a friendly game of softball but it wasn't just about the game; it was about coming together for a good cause. All the proceeds from the day went toward supporting Women‚Äôs Aid and the Children‚Äôs Health Foundation. There's something in the Dublin office's water as a round of applause is in order for Holly Mullane, who had an engagement on holidays in Italy. We're already dusting off our hats in anticipation of that long-awaited wedding invite. üé©üíç

The Rugby World Cup kicked off with high hopes that Ireland can progress deep into the tournament.

We will also have plans in place should Ireland make it to the final - C'mon Ireland!üèâüáÆüá™ü•á
