              <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">A Warm Welcome to Alana Loftus, Our First Boston Reporter. The Irish Star US is absolutely thrilled to introduce Alana Loftus as the latest addition to the Irish Star team, stepping into the role of our first Boston reporter. The team is very excited about getting stuck into one of the US' most vital Irish communities. <br>Congratulations are in order for Nadia Wynn (n√©e Breen), who managed to find time to leave the depths of the Belfast Live early shift to marry Conor - and jet off to Dubai. Love must be in the air in Belfast as it's the team's second wedding of the summer, after Conor Coyle tied the knot with Megan in Malaga before honeymooning in Vietnam. 
<br>Elsewhere, a warm welcome to Andrew Quinn who has joined the Irish Mirror team from National World.
Let's dive into the world of commercial! In our Belfast office the NI Reach Solutions team attended a PANI Business Breakfast with Kantar Media at the new Ulster University campus in Belfast. A valuable, informative and insightful morning was had as the new NI data release was presented on the latest consumer consumption trends across the media landscape.


<br><br>Our very own Caroline Christie recently played the role of judge for Zenith's internal awards known as the "Zemmies."  She singled out the McDonald's team campaign #McNuggetworthy as her personal favourite. Their campaign was a standout as it was an all-encompassing campaign using many touchpoints to reach out to the selected audience. Our Reach Solutions team also participated in Denstu‚Äôs annual DIG Day, where suppliers from across the industry faced off in a friendly game of softball. But it wasn't just about the game; it was about coming together for a good cause. All the proceeds from the day went toward supporting Women‚Äôs Aid and the Children‚Äôs Health Foundation. There's something in the Dublin office's water as a round of applause is in order for Holly Mullane, who had an engagement on holidays in Italy. We're already dusting off our hats in anticipation of that long-awaited wedding invite. üé©üíç
<br>In Marketing news, Belfast Live and the Daily Mirror NI were once again the media partners for the Belfast City Half Marathon. Despite the rain 6,000 people took to the streets of Belfast for the 10th year of the event. We were the go to place for live results and race day coverage. Pictures in folder. 
<br>The Rugby World Cup kicked off at the start of the month, with high hopes that Ireland could progress deep into the tournament. The free Rugby World Cup wallchart, featured across our three daily titles, became a fan-favourite, driving lifts by 2-3%. We will also have plans in place should Ireland make it to the final - C'mon Ireland!üèâüáÆüá™ü•á
If you're undertaking an Annual Leave Press Trip or Press Travel, you will need to log any intended travel plans on Jira so health and safety are made aware and risk assessments can be sent to them and/or prepared for more complex trips, etc. There is going to be training set up for journalists, but it is just a simple form that needs to be filled in through Buzz link <a href="https://sites.google.com/reachplc.com/buzz/health-safety-security/security/press-trips-press-travel?authuser=0" style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;"><b>here.</b></a> 

<br><br>The Recognition Corner is in full swing‚Äîan initiative led by our dedicated Reach managers to honour your achievements. Rest assured, your efforts have not gone unnoticed, so congratulations to Danny De Vaal who donning a flak jacket to face rogue seagulls and also surprised ,11 year-old Kyle Morrissey who never misses a copy of his favourite paper. A big thank you from the business and a oken of our appreciation is currently on its way to you.
<br>Stay tuned for more stories of success each monthüåüüéâüèÜ

Last Wednesday the Belfast office hosted a coffee morning in aid of MacMillan Cancer and judging by the photos it was a great success. Well done to the organisers and bakers for the delicious cakes and treats. Dublin will be hosting their coffee morning in aid of Focus Ireland some time in early November. Dates and details to follow.

<br><br>Finally we bid a grand farewell to a 23-Year Legend: Andy Coone, Our IT Guru who has been an invaluable part of our team for an astounding 23 years. On behalf of all of us, we would like to say a heartfelt thank you to Andy for all his wisdom and support over the last 23 years. From playing Santa at Christmas for all our kids, to giving us the wise 'turn it off and turn it on again sage advice,' you will be really missed by all of us.
