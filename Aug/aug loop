                <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">I love writing fictional stories (I'd love to publish something one day) and I usually do a lot of research for them so I have all these random facts in my head that might make me a great pub quiz team member </p>
              
            <h4 style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">Career if I wasn't in Media:</h4>
             <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">I can barely remember a time when I did not want to be in Media but I fancied becoming an archeologist when I was seven.</p>

             <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">I probably would work in the field of psychology. Either forensics or counseling.</p>

             <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">I would probably have to put my politics degree to use then and to be honest getting paid to do very little always appeals to me</p>

              <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">In other news from across the business, the marketing team kicked off the World Cup activity in style with a special pullout inside the Irish Star. This pullout included a fantastic colouring competition for kids, featuring great prizes such as a ‚Ç¨100 Currys voucher, a family pass to Emerald Park, and Odeon cinema tickets. The Irish Mirror launched a heartwarming competition, asking readers to submit support messages for the Ireland squad, with a chance to win a smart TV. They also had an action-packed week at Belsonic and helped to host the RSVP relaunch party.
                
<br><br>At the start of the month, the news was dominated by the RTE Pay Scandal. Both the Irish Daily Mirror and Irish Daily Star witnessed a strong sales performance over the two week period. The Women's World Cup poster/wallchart proved to be a game-changer, driving a 3% increase in sales for the Mirror and Star and we are hopeful that we'll see a further sales uplift off the back of Ireland's participation in the tournament, particularly if they manage to qualify from their group. The Daily Mirror in NI continues to perform robustly despite the 12th Bank Holiday weekend, which is typically a slow period for sale. The RSVP June issue closed just shy of 17k, whilst our second instalment of RSVP Country is still on the shelves.

<br><br>Across the pond, IrishStar.com is going from strength to strength. The site saw its biggest audience day during the Titan sub tragedy, with a total audience of 1.3 million PV (on-site and off-site). The team is set for a record-breaking month in July.

<br><br>Moving over to the commercial team, as part of their exciting year long partnership with Sky Sports, we‚Äôve been busy with Women‚Äôs National Team Partnership which gives Sky a really strong presence across print and digital . Sky‚Äôs impactful Outbelieve creative sits alongside world cup content across our platforms, with some really innovative formats such as a pull out team poster and a countdown webstrip. COYGIG!

<br>The team also hosted an exclusive event at Zozimus in St. Anne's Lane, inviting 50 clients from 10+ ad agencies and numerous direct clients for the RSVP relaunch. Additionally, they treated their ten top clients to a foodie haven experience at Taste of Dublin.

In Belfast, Reach sponsored a prestigious prize at the 2023 Annual Awards held by Ulster University's School of Communication and Media. The recipient of this award was Berni Neill, Strategic Segment Marketing Manager at Calor Gas, who achieved the highest grade average at Diploma level in the esteemed Postgraduate Programme in Digital Marketing Communication & Leadership (insert picture of wallschart and Aimee and RSVP launch.
