              <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">Welcome to our February edition of the Loop in 2023. We’ve waved an enthusiastic bye bye to the 47960 days of January and things are looking a lot brighter! We’ve had an amazing start to the year with both editorial and commercial having had some excellent wins. <br>Don't forget to get in touch with us at <a href="mailto:theloopireland@reachplc.com" style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;"><b>theloopireland@reachplc.com</b></a> for anything you would like to see us cover.

              <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">The marketing team delivered a digital first promotion for Slimming World offering readers the chance to join free of charge using high-impact editorial and advertising formats: articles, newsletters, webstrips, digital display and social media across all NI & ROI sites. This was complemented by pre-promo ads in print, an 8-page recipe pullout in the Irish Daily Mirror & Mirror NI, and two magazines in the Irish Daily Star, Irish Daily Mirror & Mirror NI. We have seen exceptional results across the board.                                                                       Adam visiting baby Adam for the first time! Thanks Maggie for sharing these adorable photos!

              <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">It has been a typical heads down kind of January on the social front but thankfully there were lots of great stories and reporting going on.
It was great to see a packed newsroom in the Belfast office when Irish Mirror production staff had a new year meet-up. Some people met for the first time in a long time and some for the first time ever! And we are looking forward to more of the same in 2023. A similar get together for Irish Daily Star production as well as news and reporting colleagues in Dublin will hopefully happen in the brand new Talbot Street office sometime in February. January also saw some great stories and journalism that got the year off to a good start. Some highlights included Paul Healy and Michael O’Toole’s coverage of the Gerry Hutch trial which won over a new audience of listeners to the Star’s Shattered Lives podcast. John Hand who from day one has done the best reporting on one of the big early stories of the year, the sad story of little Alejandro Mizsan who was horrifically attacked by a dog. And Louise Burne who broke new ground on the story of Pascal Donohoe’s election expenses.Finally we would like to wish everyone well with the imminent launch of the irishstar.com website in the US, and especially Laura Colgan and Katie Gallagher who hope to be heading stateside soon to be part of this exciting new chapter. Best of luck!

              <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">Our commercial teams have been busy with a brilliant start to 2023 with big wins and media partnerships such as Beauty Excellence from our NI team whilst the Dublin office has had some great wins from Nicorette, Sensodyne, and Boyle Sports. On top of this, we’ve had a team restructure with Hugh Crowther appointed as Group Sales Director for Reach Solutions in ROI. Hugh now heads up the entire commercial function in the market, continuing our transformation to a digital-first business. When he’s not working, Hugh can be found practising his other passions - darts and debating a juicy conspiracy theory.  Wishing Hugh the very best of luck in his new role. 
Also a big welcome to Tess Braidner who has joined the commercial team as an intern for 15 weeks from the University of Belfast.</p>

There is a book as you enter that needs to be filled in on arrival and when leaving the office (even for lunch/meetings etc). This is an official document for Health & Safety or a Fire emergency.

              <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">The December issue of RSVP sold 20,322 (8% YoY), whilst the RSVP Country Special which went out at the end of November sold 12,418, which is a good number in a very challenging magazine market due to the cost of living crisis. Our Slimming World magazines at the start of January supported by TV and radio delivered some significant sales increases across the Irish Daily Mirror (10%), Irish Sunday Mirror (7%), Daily Mirror (5%), Sunday Mirror (4%) and Irish Daily Star (4%), and has given us a really positive start to the year - ensuring that all titles should finish ahead of the budget forecast for the month of January. Onwards and Upwards!
