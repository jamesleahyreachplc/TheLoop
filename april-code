              <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">Welcome to the Easter edition of the Loop! We are delighted to bring you the latest news from across Reach Ireland. As we are preparing for upcoming award ceremonies, and the long weekend we have a lot to be excited about. This issue of the Loop includes highlights from our commercial team's wins and achievements, updates from circulation and production, and a special 5 minutes with Ryan Smith, our editor at IrishStar. Our team in Belfast has been nominated for an award, and our Belfast and Dublin hubs are full of Easter cheer! So, join us as we celebrate the successes of the past quarter, and let us know what else you would like to see us cover by emailing  <a href="mailto:theloopireland@reachplc.com" style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;"><b>theloopireland@reachplc.com</b></a>. <br>Don't forget to share your Easter photos with us, and have a safe and happy Easter!

              <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">Marketing kicked off Cheltenham with their fully integrated campaign across Ireland. They had print pocket guides, bumper preview magazines, daily pullouts & free bets with pre-promo print ads, radio campaigns, and social media campaigns. The live blogs, Robbie Power column, and Peter O'Hehir tips were all heavily promoted. The new horse racing newsletter gained 1,200 new subscribers during the festival. Digital display ads, web strips, Facebook ads, re-engagement campaigns, cross-promotional emails, and a competition to win an overnight stay in Dublin City Centre with access to the Paddy Power Fanzone all helped to boost subscriptions. It's safe to say that Cheltenham was a great success!

              <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">We'd like to offer congratulations to our features editor Larissa Nolan who celebrated her wedding to Conor McManamly in March. Never one to miss a good story opportunity, we look forward to reading about Larissa and Conor's honeymoon tourism adventures in the Florida Keys in an upcoming travel feature! No pun intended but there were stunning jumps across the Cheltenham week on both the Irish Daily Star and Irish Mirror on both titles for the week. More importantly there were great papers all week from front to back pages for those who bought them. Not least in the top coverage of Ireland's triumphant Grand Slam week. Well done too to political correspondent Louise Burne who did a great job as our woman in Washington this year for the St Patrick's Day White House festivities. Top class reporting online and in print when she wasn't popping up all over the airwaves! 
<br>Thanks and well done to all the editorial teams for great coverage. 
               <br> Congratulations to Justin Kernoghan and Mick O'Neill for being shortlisted for the AIB Press Photographer Association of Ireland (PPAI) awards held in Dublin on the 3rd of March. Justin Kernoghan, a Belfast-based photographer, covers a wide range of news and features across Northern Ireland for the Daily Mirror, Irish Star, and Belfast Live. Mick O'Neill has had several front-page images published in the Irish Mirror and Irish Star over the past two years. We can't wait to see what they'll achieve next!

              <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">The commercial team has had a positive start to the quarter. They have been actively engaging with agency partners and showcasing their expertise by presenting at various awards. One such event was the "Knowing Me, Knowing You" event where they managed to walk away with two lucrative briefs. The team was thrilled to have the opportunity to build long-lasting relationships with clients.
<br>Furthermore, during the Cheltenham week, all bookies including Boyles, Betfair, William Hill & LiveScore were heavily active on digital, which was a fantastic sight to see. The cherry on top of all this great news was the announcement that the commercial team has won a year-long Sky partnership from Off the Ball.
<br>Did you know that news is still a beloved medium for adults? According to NewsBrands Ireland, 82% of adults read a print or online title every week. News lovers are particularly attentive to newspaper and online ads, with an 18% higher likelihood of paying most attention to them compared to the average adult. Newspapers and online ads are ranked among the top three mediums for attention and purchase decisions. NewsBrands Ireland has even launched a new print and digital campaign to celebrate this enduring love for news! More details here

              <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">Our biggest week of the year is in March and we sold in excess of 90k extra papers week on week across our three daily titles during Cheltenham. But even with this success, the February issue of RSVP still closed at 17,507 - not an easy feat in the current cost of living crisis. Our competitors, such as VIP, Stellar, and Irish Country magazine, have also experienced heavy sales decreases this month. 
<br>April looks to be packed with newsworthy events, from the visits of two Presidents to the Hutch trial resuming and anniversaries of the Good Friday Agreement. We also have three major racing festivals - the Irish Grand National, Aintree Grand National, and Punchestown - to look forward to at the end of the month.

Mark Kavanagh moves to steer that ship from the first week of April. March was also a fruitful month for Belfast, Cork and RSVP, despite Facebook's best efforts to stop us in our tracks.
