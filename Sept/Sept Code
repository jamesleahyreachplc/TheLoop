             <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">If I wasn't in media I'd love to have been a sports physio, working with a top rugby team (I mean I def haven't given this much thought though..!)</p>

            <h4 style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">Greatest Obsession:</h4>
              <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">CI think I probably have different obsessions at different time, Man United are becoming a more continuous obsession every season! As a family growing up they were always our team but since having my son and as he gets older its an obsession we both enjoy together! I also love music and really enjoy going to concerts & live gigs when I can! </p>

             <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">Clocked up some interesting travel miles over the course of my career. My belief that it's easier to be a good host than a good guest saw me eat sheep's eyeballs in Kazakhstan and guineapig in Peru. Other places I worled like Lebanon, New York and Talbot St. have been less challenging in culinary terms!</p>

              <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">Reach shines the spotlight on the incredible women of Irish sport. First off, our marketing team celebrated local heroines throughout the country who are making significant strides for women's sports in Ireland. RSVP invited readers to nominate the unsung champions of women's sports – those who toil behind the scenes. From the nominations, a shortlist of 10 finalists were identified and put to a public vote with over 2000 votes cast. The victor emerged as the chairman of Donegal Town FC, an organisation boasting 400 members, committed to enhancing the mental well-being of people within that club

<br><br>While on the subject of women's sports, the editorial team wanted to give a big shout-out to Sandra Mallon who is pictured with her trophy for Most Improved Player of the season at Sword Women's Rugby club. Not to be confused as it was by some envious rivals for another showbiz reporting gong. And though it was back in May we can't not mention Zoe Watson who picked up the Women's Championship Manager of the year award at the Northern Ireland Futsal Federation awards. 
<br><br>t wasn't all play and no work as summer has seen another string of big stories and great editorial energy. We've had journalists joining peacekeeping forces in Lebanon and reporting from the scene of the tragic deaths of hundreds of migrants in Greece. At home the Irish Daily Star/Irish Mirror campaign to highlight rising violence against women has been recognised by the Taoiseach and Justice Minister, and is a good example of a great collaborative effort across the newsroom. We've also led the way on a summer of big stories from the sad deaths of Christy Dignam and Sinead O'Connor to the crisis in RTE. Not to mention Danny De Vall who courageously donned helmet and flak jacket to report from the the frontline of the battle of Drogheda , a town besieged by seagulls. It even earned him an honourable mention as reporter of the day on the morning paper reviews. Where Seagulls Dare! 


<br><br>We plan to add a few more social gatherings at the office for chats and catch-ups in the coming weeks so hope to see more faces in Talbot Street which - contrary to rumours that even the seagulls go around in pairs - is actually not that bad!

 <br><br>Belfast Live and Mirror NI have once again united as media partners for CHSq at the iconic Custom House Square in Belfast. The stage saw international acts like Becky Hill, Belters Only, and Kodaline perform. The Festival partnership season ended with a 2-day dance music festival called Emerge where thousands showed up to watch some of the biggest dance music artists in the world. With prominent branding and activations, it was another incredibly successful year

In Belfast, Reach sponsored a prestigious prize at the 2023 Annual Awards held by Ulster University's School of Communication and Media. The recipient of this award was Berni Neill, Strategic Segment Marketing Manager at Calor Gas, who achieved the highest grade average at Diploma level in the esteemed Postgraduate Programme in Digital Marketing Communication & Leadership.

 <br><br>On the circulation front, the Galway Races delivered a great sales  return across both the Mirror (8.5% week-on-week increase) and the Star (12% week-on-week increase) despite having no free bets this year, which we had last year. The Irish Daily Star also had a free Premier League fixtures magazine on the Friday of Galway week...The cover price increases across the whole Reach Ireland portfolio coincided with return of the Premier League on Saturday 12th August, and early market indications are suggesting that all titles are holding up well and ahead of budget for the month, which is encouraging.

              <p style="color: #3D5161;font-family: Tahoma;">CReach has joined forces with Oxfam for their Secondhand September campaign. Starting now, our staff can contribute by bringing in clothes they no longer need and placing them in the designated Oxfam bin. This bin is conveniently located on the Commercial side of the Dublin Hub, right beside the photocopier and in the kitchen within the Belfast Hub.At the end of the month, Reach will organise the transfer of the clothes to local Oxfam shops. This initiative encourages individuals to purchase secondhand items while promoting mindful consumption that benefits both people and the planet.
